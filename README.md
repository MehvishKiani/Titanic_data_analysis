# Titanic_data_analysis
Exploratory data analysis and logistic regression modeling on the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival.
The analysis begins by importing necessary libraries and loading the Titanic dataset. The initial exploration includes displaying the number of passengers present, visualizing survival counts, and examining survival rates based on sex and passenger class. Histograms are plotted for age and fare distributions, followed by assessing the presence of missing values and handling them through dropping irrelevant columns and rows. Categorical variables like sex, embarked port, and passenger class are converted into dummy variables for modeling purposes.

After preprocessing, the dataset is prepared for modeling by splitting it into training and testing sets. Logistic regression is employed as the predictive model due to its simplicity and interpretability. The model is trained on the training set and evaluated using various metrics such as classification report, confusion matrix, and accuracy score on the test set, providing insights into its predictive performance on survival prediction.
